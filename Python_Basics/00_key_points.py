""" Key Points

* Python is an interpreted language which can save you considerable
  time during program development because no compilation and linking 
  is necessary.

* Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs
  written in Python are typically shorter than equivalent C, C++ or Java programs
  because:
  
  1- The high-level data types are allowed in Python.
  2- Statement grouping is done by indentation instead of brackets.
  3- No variable or argument declarations are necessary.
  
  * Python is extensbile. You can add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter
    written in C or C++ language.

# Invoking the interpreter(interactive mode):
python 3.9


# Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line:
#!/usr/bin/env python3.9


# You can execute a Python script by:
python <script_name>


""" Source Code Encoding

* By default Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.

* To declare an encoding other than the default:
# -*- coding: <encoding_type> -*-

* For example Windows-1252 encoding:
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
